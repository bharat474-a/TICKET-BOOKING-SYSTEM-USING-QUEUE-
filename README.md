# TICKET-BOOKING-SYSTEM-USING-QUEUE-
Console-based Dynamic Booking Dispatch System built in C. It uses a custom-implemented queue data structure to manage patron service flow (FIFO), featuring ticket issuing, serving, and an array-shifting method for voiding specific tickets out of order while preserving queue integrity. Ideal for demonstrating core data structure operations.
